            What is Cryptopinions?
        </div>
        <div class='aboutcontents'>
            Cryptopinions is a new social media twist on cryptocollectibles. Register and own unique opinions on the Ethereum blockchain, or sponsor existing opinions! <br><br>
            
            To view and interact with Cryptopinions, you must first have <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> installed.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Own</h3>Each opinion is a full fledged ERC-721 Token, and unlike similar games, is permanently yours as long as you hold it. Once you have registered an opinion, you own it; no valid duplicate may be created, and you may sell or trade it as you see fit on a variety of platforms.<br>As holder of the opinion token, 10% of every sponsorship for it goes to you, meaning substantial dividends for popular opinions. Cryptopinions takes no fees from sponsorships, all sponsorship fees go to the owner.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Sponsor</h3>Sponsoring opinions lets you show support for an opinion by paying a specific and progressively increasing sum of Ethereum. 90% goes to the last sponsor, 10% to the opinion owner. When the next person sponsors the same opinion, you get your Eth back and then some. When an opinion is sponsored, it becomes marked with a green check and a sponsor selected word of support, and becomes listed more prominently (sorted by price to sponsor).
            <br><br>
            <h3>Anti-Sponsor</h3>Don't agree? Anti-Sponsoring works the same as sponsoring, but your Eth goes 90% to the previous antisponsor and 10% to Cryptopinions instead of to the sponsor and the opinion owner.<br>Just like with Sponsoring, the price increases each time, meaning that an opinion becomes more expensive to sponsor for every antisponsor and vice-versa. This means that by antisponsoring, you not only show your distaste for an opinion with a red check and negative comment, but also remove potential dividends from the opinion holder.
